# Renewed-Vehicleparser

People were selling something as simple as this shit so I just made it in like 5 minutes with code from ox_core and ox_inventory.

Not really anything unique nor special just do /generatecarlist ingame and it will generate all your missing cars (works with imports too)

## Dependencies
ox_lib
